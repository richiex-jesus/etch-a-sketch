# etch-a-sketch
this is my etch-a-sketch project under TOP! praise the Lord!!

pseudocode:

- making the skeleton for etch-a-sketch
add a header, a container and a footer to the HTML page.
for the container (which should be in the middle), add a div with id "container" into the main HTML file.

- creating the 16x16 grid at the start of etch-a-sketch
use flexbox such that the container has a height and width of 960px. 
use a for loop to make (16 ** 2 = 256) new divs. start from i = 0 up to i = 256.
